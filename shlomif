A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation,
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is also
forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutten
as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different beasts). Finally,
chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not be eaten along with
any mammal’s milk either.

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it would
have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

switched the help systems of the upcoming Windows 98, as well as Microsoft
Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested that
the Windows’ manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be
designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE4. While this project
is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a large
momentum soon.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity 
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and 
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that 
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as 
it is.

A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School.

What most people think is something like that:

<<<

The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one
place, and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people,
because he feared they’ll reach him. So he casted an 8th level Spell of
Language Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and
without being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across
the Earth. God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl. 
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks 
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so 
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to 
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you 
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to 
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of 
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for 
Python).

A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get to the bottom of a

inside it. I asked my question and soon afterwards received:

* One Thunderbird recommendation.

* Two Evolution recommendations.

* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.

* One GMail recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was
completely out of the question due to my work’s constraints.

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to FreeNode’s #debian channel, where there are many knowledgable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw.

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl Gods, there

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but 
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

       <rillo>  ??
     <rindolf>  rillo: Python does not have a ++ operator.
 <scorchsaber>  rindolf: Oh, but it does have a + operator.
       <rillo>  ah. i'm new to python so i diddnt know
 <scorchsaber>  A few days ago, it was suggested that I implement ++ using
                the + operator.
 <scorchsaber>  And I did so. :)
 <scorchsaber>  So, really, a++; is valid in Python, and it may even
                increment a by one. If somebody was crazy, anyhow, and if
                a was mutable.
       <rillo>  shall i move back to perl to get the ++

  <TimToady>  no, English was my first language. :)
   <rindolf>  TimToady: I started with XT ROM BASIC, but I suppose it was
              something like Perl 5 was to Perl 4 for your BASIC.
   <rindolf>  BASIC has greatly evolved since Dartmouth BASIC.
   <rindolf>  TimToady: ah.

     <Juerd>  21:04 <@TimToady> we have a test suite right now because of

     <Juerd>  Very, very important.
   <rindolf>  diakopter: I don't know.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: yes, very.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: anyway, I expect that at every given time all tests
              will pass.
     <Juerd>  Well, there are probably bad tests too :)
     <Juerd>  Given the volume of the suite, and that pugs has never been

   <rindolf>  How long does it take Pugs to run the entire Pugs test

  <pmurias>  rindolf: what is Park/Spark?
  <rindolf>  pmurias:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Park-Lisp/
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's still incomplete.
  <rindolf>  And I haven't updated it.
  <pmurias>  rindolf: if you like lisp/perl6 projects you might consider
             helping with a common lisp elf backend
  <rindolf>  pmurias: Common Lisp.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: thing is I think both CL and Scheme suck.
  <rindolf>  I like Lisp as a concept.
  <rindolf>  Arc is nice, but has too many implementation problems.
  <rindolf>  And missing features.
    <vixey>  Arc is not nice
  <rindolf>  I want to give a presentation to the Perl Mongers about
             "Foreign Languages: Lisp"
  <rindolf>  vixey: I like it.
  <rindolf>  Though I hate that "(not)" has become "(no)"
  <rindolf>  it's so non-English.
    <vixey>  it's just TCL with horrible syntax
  <rindolf>  vixey: but it's missing a lot of exciting features.
  <rindolf>  Which PG deemed as unnecessary.
  <rindolf>  Doesn't look like the 100-years language to me.
  <rindolf>  Which is why - Spark!
  <pmurias>  why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?
  <rindolf>  pmurias: could be.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's another approach.
  <rindolf>  But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.
  <rindolf>  For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list
             concat.
  <rindolf>  While Python does and it seems to be OK in Arc too.
  <rindolf>  And in CL you have (concatenate) (yuck!).
  <pbuetow>  (((hehe)))
  <pmurias>  + for strings sucks
    <Auzon>  seconded.
    <vixey>  rindolf: If you don't like CONCATENATE you can just rename it
  <rindolf>  vixey: yeah.
  <rindolf>  vixey: but I'd rather not rename concatenate because then
             people won't understand my code.
  <rindolf>  vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.
    <vixey>  yes they will rindolf
  <rindolf>  They want things to work out of the box.
    <vixey>  A program is many many totally newly defined procedures
    <vixey>  just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big
             program
  <rindolf>  vixey: "let's spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day
             implementing the solution with it."
 <TimToady>  if it would take 10 days without the new language, it's worth
             it
  <rindolf>  TimToady: yeah.
  <rindolf>  TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.
    <vixey>  no it's not
  <rindolf>  Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.
    <vixey>  CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that
  <rindolf>  vixey: I meant a common idiom there.
  <rindolf>  I think I'll /quit and do something productive.
  <rindolf>  Like work on Spark.
    <vixey>  another quote:
    <vixey>  how to write any computer program in two easy stages:
    <vixey>  Design and implement the programming language which would be
             best for solving the problem.
    <vixey>  Write the program in the language you’ve just implemented.
  <rindolf>  vixey: or just use Perl which is the best for everything.
    <vixey>  heh
 <TimToady>  the second step is obvious--the best language for the job is
             one that does the job on a null input
          *  pmichaud notes that vixey's algorithm is somewhat recursive
 <TimToady>  "All rules of thumb are false, including this one."
  <pmurias>  rindolf: when you feel like writing Common Lisp backends,
             contact me or mncharity ;)

that you know.

Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in a conference I was

They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures, but besides of that
- they are quite a trusted service.

Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new editor, "Emacs" on
the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99. In order to package it, he invokes
the trusty ol’ module-starter (see
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates a skeleton of a
CPAN distribution for him.

He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types "perl Build.PL",
and "./Build test" and makes sure all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build
config --gui" and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the
Module meta-data.[M-B-Data]

In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and selects
categories. This is done in a similar way to Freshmeat’s project
categorisation dialog (a list of options to the left, with selected options to
the right and arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
select options.). He chooses such categories as "Programming Language ::
Lisp", and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and
"Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be fetched using
a public web-service to keep them up-to-date.)

After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has received many
patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now Emacs is not only an editor
but a calendar tool, an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and
many other things.

So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
categorisation. He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds more categories.
However, he enters too many categories (because Emacs now does them all), and
the GUI refuses to save the file because it will overflow the limit that the
web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to handle. So
Richard keeps only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves it.

He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new distribution to the
CPAN.

Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman’s Emacs as the
basis of his company’s state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macros™ is a
commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores,
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends
patches to Richard and learns a lot about it.

When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he surfs to the Emacs
homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.

Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

PHP error debug list:

1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good programmer, use
the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you’re not a
good programmer, or you learned php’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).

2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. php will do it for you so you
can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into
your sql queries.

  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I played with Squeak a little and yes I'd like
             a vim clone written in perl.
  <Makoryu>  Why isn't there one already, then?
  <Makoryu>  (A vim clone in Perl)
  <Su-Shee>  good question. there's one in javascript :)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: actually , it's a vi clone.
  <rindolf>  Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.
  <rindolf>  Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing
             a Perl 6 implementation.
  <rindolf>  Unless you're Chuck Norris.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?
  <moritz_>  no, he scared K&R into writing it ;-)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire
             Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack
             breaks.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I know - he published slackware under the
             pseudonym patrick volkerding...
  <rindolf>  Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.
   <araujo>  the second time includes fixing all its errors
  <moritz_>  but he didn't commmit his changes, it seems
  <rindolf>  moritz_: heh.
  <rindolf>  LOL.
   <araujo>  Chuck Norris doesn't commit changes, the changes commit for
             him
   <araujo>  :)
  <rindolf>  Code is too scared of Chuck to be wrong.
  <rindolf>  It is generated right in the first time.
  <rindolf>  Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris' computer.
  <Su-Shee>  .o(I see a chuck norris release on the horizon... ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: :-)
  <Su-Shee>  we could ask chuck norris if he's willing to promote the star
             release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to
             laughter.. :)
   <araujo>  Perl 6 - A Chuck Norris like language
 <dukeleto>  Chuck Norris has actually been using Perl 6 since 1987, and

  <Su-Shee>  rakudo - chuck's choice ;)
  <Su-Shee>  well, camelia and chuck norris go well together. ;)
  <rindolf>  OK.
  <rindolf>  Of course everybody know Chuck Norris is a real programmer.
  <rindolf>  He designs machines by combining individual atoms.
  <rindolf>  Using his thought.
  <rindolf>  Atoms obey Chuck Norris.

 <shlomif>  Larry Wall seems a bit less funny on IRC than on Usenet or

 <shlomif>  But he's not always funny.
 <shlomif>  IRL, he's really funny.
 <shlomif>  He gives funny presentations.
   <sjors>  I don't have the place in ottd to *force* them to do the right
            thing, but they do stuff like making 90 degree corners,
            stopping three other trains in their tracks, just because it's

 <whoppix>  Quick git question, perhaps someone knows the answer: I have a
            file in my git tree (locally and in the repository), but I
            want git to ignore the file completely, i.e. git is not to
            touch the file on the filesystem by updating it or merging
            local changes into the repostiroy
 <rindolf>  whoppix: you can use .gitignore
 <rindolf>  I think
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hmm, good idea, thanks.
 <whoppix>  that was slow.
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hm, I think git update-index --assume-unchanged is
            what I need.
 <whoppix>  .gitignore is only for untracked files
 <rindolf>  whoppix: OK, have no clue what that is.
 <rindolf>  Git is so complicated.
 <rindolf>  And so opaque
 <whoppix>  rindolf, me neither, but the doc tells me to use that.
 <rindolf>  whoppix: can you believe the docs?
 <rindolf>  The docs may be lying.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust the docs.

Mike “The Mouse” House (a.k.a “D.J. Sallinger”) was a minor rap artist, and a
computer geek when he decided to start selling CDs of open-source software. He
turned to spamming to publicise his business, but found out that the spam he
sent was trapped by most spam traps. He decided to use the notorious obscured
image spam, but since he had a few blind friends, decided to also include an
audio recording of a rap song with the spam message.

House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his real break came
when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it on the Internet, where it
became an instant hit. The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made
D.J. Sallinger famous, who quickly released his first successful album called
/Rap to the spam, Ma’am!/, with such highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to not get
trapped” and “He ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.

As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money back to sponsoring
open-source projects, and has donated 100,000’s of U.S. Dollars to such causes
as [the Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), [Linux
International](http://www.li.org/) and
[SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/). “If it hadn’t been for them,
I wouldn’t have made it big”, he said, and said he’s now working on a second
album with a similar theme.

All languages of the world suck. If you require people to declare variables
(like in Pascal, C,
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) or
Perl 5 with [strict](http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html)), then people will
tell you they like variables to spring up upon first use. Without variable
declarations, then you get various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping.
If you use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more and there’s
more clutter. With indentation-based scoping (like in Python), you’ll find it
hard to introduce multiple-expression
[lambdas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions).

Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming (OOP) and so they
didn’t introduce it in their
[“Go”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) and
[“Arc“](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29)
languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess what? Many people,
including me, think that OOP is still a good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++
did not do OOP very well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
closely at Go.

Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or Lisp) possibly
suffer from many subtle errors ; Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are
less expressive and it seems that about one third of the language design
papers published on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) are
about various funky extensions to the Haskell type system to allow for better
expressiveness.

Purely functional languages have no assignment and most people find them
harder, in part because the world around us has a lot of state, and they also
need to do funky compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and so are prone to
many errors.

If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions or Perl 5’s “last
LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to
not be factored correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers will
hate you for having to go through many hoops to write quick-and-dirty code.

Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is treated magically by
the parser. PHP and Java use strings for them, and require weird escaping and
backslashing rules to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions, then people will
want similar first-order syntaxes for XPath, for XML (like some recent
versions of Visual Basic .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need
to embed.

Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created by the leading
[sigils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29) of
Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but they allow for much
better backward compatibility, facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (=
embedding inside strings), and also give some important visual cues when
skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).

As expected from the latest trend in the Perl blogosphere this post will be
about Roles. And Moose! And Roles in Moose! And Moose in Roles! And Roles
outside Moose…

Seriously now, this is a post about a completely non-Moosey and non-Roley
script I wrote to filter the use.perl.org master journals' feed.

          <rindolf>  Hi all.
         <Leuthihi>  O HAI rindolf
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: HAI HAI.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: what's up?
         <Leuthihi>  rindolf: I'm hungry!
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: there's one antidote for it.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: it's called Food.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: </bolt>
         <Leuthihi>  well, but what food?
         <Leuthihi>  and I need coffee
         <Leuthihi>  oh, I think I know what I'll have.
 <benwbrum_chez_so>  Chili. A big bowl of red, with crackers and onions on
                     the side.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: does it matter?
            <Volis>  If it has to be some cuisine.
            <Volis>  Did I spell correctly?
          <rindolf>  Volis: spell what?
            <Volis>  oh yes.
            <Volis>  cuisine.
          <rindolf>  "cuisine" is spelt this way.
          <rindolf>  Yes.
          <rindolf>  It's a French word I think.
          <rindolf>  .ety cuisine
           <la_fen>  "1786, from Fr. cuisine 'style of cooking,'
                     originally 'kitchen, cooking, cooked food' (12c.),
                     from L.L. cocina, earlier coquina 'kitchen,' from L.
                     coquere 'to cook' (see cook (n.))." -
                     http://etymonline.com/?term=cuisine
          <rindolf>  OK, originally from Latin.
            <Volis>  nevermind. Which cuisine is the best?
            <Volis>  In general
          <rindolf>  Volis: I like many cuisines.
           <Gvidon>  Russian, of course
          <rindolf>  Volis: though most of the ethnic food is actually
                     poor men's food.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: Russian cuisine?
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Yes
         <Leuthihi>  well, yes, because I need something to eat to be able
                     to eat it.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: what does it feature?
            <Volis>  Russian cuisine lacks flavour.
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Vodka
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: ah.
         <Leuthihi>  In Soviet Russia, food tastes YOU!
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: I didn't know Vodka is nutritious
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: :-)
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, They no longer use this meme. :P
         <Leuthihi>  Vodka has plenty of calories at least.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: and I don't consume Alcoholic beverages in
                     any quantity.
          <rindolf>  Volis: :-)
         <Leuthihi>  Volis: because: In Soviet Russia, meme uses You!
          <rindolf>  «In Soviet Russia, cats own you. Oh wait! They own
                     you everywhere.»
            <Volis>  Considering the fact, i'm still underage. Please
                     change the topic.
          <rindolf>  Volis: underage?
          <rindolf>  Volis: ah, you cannot drink?
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, left keeps you. Always.
            <Volis>  "Dear fellow driver, let left be for communist crap
                     only"
            <Volis>  rindolf, Rules of the world.
