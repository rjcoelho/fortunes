Abstract factory
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.
%
Builder
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation allowing 
the same construction process to create various representations.
%
Factory method
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which 
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to 
subclasses (dependency injection[16]).
%
Lazy initialization
Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or 
some other expensive process until the first time it is needed.
%
Multiton
Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide global point of access to 
them.
%
Object pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that 
are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and 
thread pool patterns.
%
Prototype
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and 
create new objects by copying this prototype.
%
Resource acquisition is initialization
Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of 
suitable objects.
%
Singleton
Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to 
it.
%
Adapter or Wrapper
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An 
adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of 
incompatible interfaces.
%
Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary 
independently.
%
Composite
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects 
uniformly.
%
Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same 
interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for 
extending functionality.
%
Facade
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade 
defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
%
Front Controller
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Front 
Controller defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to 
use.
%
Flyweight
Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
%
Proxy
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
%
Blackboard
Generalized observer, which allows multiple readers and writers. Communicates 
information system-wide.
%
Chain of responsibility
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one 
object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the 
request along the chain until an object handles it.
%
Command
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients 
with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
%
Interpreter
Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an 
interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
%
Iterator
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially 
without exposing its underlying representation.
%
Mediator
Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator 
promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other 
explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
%
Memento
Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal 
state allowing the object to be restored to this state later.
%
Null object
Avoid null references by providing a default object.
%
Observer or Publish/subscribe
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one 
object results with all its dependents being notified and updated automatically.
%
Servant
Define common functionality for a group of classes
%
Specification
Recombinable business logic in a Boolean fashion
%
State
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The 
object will appear to change its class.
%
Strategy
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them 
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients 
that use it.
%
Template method
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to 
subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an 
algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
%
Visitor
Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. 
Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the 
elements on which it operates.
%
Active Object
Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own 
thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous 
method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.
%
Balking
Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state.
%
Binding properties
Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be 
synchronized or coordinated in some way.
%
Messaging design pattern (MDP)
Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and 
applications.
%
Double-checked locking
Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion 
(the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual 
lock proceed.
Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can 
therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern.
%
Event-based asynchronous
Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded 
programs.
%
Guarded suspension
Manages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition 
to be satisfied before the operation can be executed.
%
Lock
One thread puts a "lock" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing 
or modifying it.
%
Monitor object
An object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing 
multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time.
%
Reactor
A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be 
handled synchronously.
%
Read-write lock
Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for 
write operations.
%
Scheduler
Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code.
%
Thread pool
A number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually 
organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be 
considered a special case of the object pool pattern.
%
Thread-specific storage
Static or "global" memory local to a thread.
