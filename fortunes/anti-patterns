Death march
Everyone knows that the project is going to be a disaster – except the CEO 
– so the truth is hidden to prevent immediate cancellation of the project - 
(although the CEO often knows and does it anyway to maximize profit). However, 
the truth remains hidden and the project is artificially kept alive until the 
Day Zero finally comes ("Big Bang"). Alternative definition: Employees are 
pressured to work late nights and weekends on a project with an unreasonable 
deadline.

Groupthink
During groupthink, members of the group avoid promoting viewpoints outside the 
comfort zone of consensus thinking

re-implement it using higher level functions

Presenting a model (usually Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)) without 
specifying its viewpoint
Big ball of mud: A system with no recognizable structure
%
Database-as-IPC
Using a database as the message queue for routine interprocess communication 
where a much more lightweight mechanism would be suitable
%
Gold plating
Continuing to work on a task or project well past the point at which extra 
effort is adding value

development platform
%

%
Stovepipe system
A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components
%
Anemic Domain Model
The use of domain model without any business logic. The domain model's objects 
cannot guarantee their correctness at any moment, because their validation and 
mutation logic is placed somewhere outside (most likely in multiple places).
%
BaseBean

Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects 
or software modules
%
Constant interface
Using interfaces to define constants
%
God object
Concentrating too many functions in a single part of the design (class)
%
Object cesspool
Reusing objects whose state does not conform to the (possibly implicit)

%
Object orgy

internals
%
Poltergeists
Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object
%
Sequential coupling
A class that requires its methods to be called in a particular order
%
Yo-yo problem
A structure (e.g., of inheritance) that is hard to understand due to excessive 
fragmentation
%
Accidental complexity
Introducing unnecessary complexity into a solution
%
Action at a distance
Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of a system
%
Blind faith
Lack of checking of (a) the correctness of a bug fix or (b) the result of a 
subroutine
%
Boat anchor
Retaining a part of a system that no longer has any use
%
Busy spin
Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated 
checking instead of messaging
%
Caching failure
Forgetting to reset an error flag when an error has been corrected
%
Cargo cult programming
Using patterns and methods without understanding why
%
Coding by exception
Adding new code to handle each special case as it is recognized
%
Error hiding
Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user and either showing 
nothing or showing a meaningless message
%
Hard code
Embedding assumptions about the environment of a system in its implementation
%
Lava flow
Retaining undesirable (redundant or low-quality) code because removing it is 
too expensive or has unpredictable consequences
%
Loop-switch sequence
Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop statement
%
Magic numbers
Including unexplained numbers in algorithms
%
Magic strings
Including literal strings in code, for comparisons, as event types etc.
%
Repeating yourself
Writing code which contains repetitive patterns and substrings over again; 
avoid with once and only once (abstraction principle)
%
Soft code
Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code[7]
%

Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible, especially because of misuse 
of code structures

Assuming that a favorite solution is universally applicable (See: Silver Bullet)
%
Improbability factor
Assuming that it is improbable that a known error will occur
%
Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome
The tendency towards reinventing the wheel (Failing to adopt an existing, 
adequate solution)
%
Premature optimization
Coding early-on for perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design, 
maintainability, and sometimes even real-world efficiency
%
Programming by permutation (or "programming by accident")
Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it 
works
%
Reinventing the wheel
Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution
%
Reinventing the square wheel
Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution 
which performs much worse than the existing one
%

Assuming that a favorite technical solution can solve a larger process or 
problem
